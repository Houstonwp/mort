    "comments": "Study Data: In discussing \"The New Standard Ordinary Mortality Table\" by Charles M. Sternhell, it was brought out that the pattern of group mortality is quite different from that of ordinary insurance and that Table x-17 (See SOA Table Identity 312), or a variant thereof, would not be appropriate as a mortality standard for premium rates for group life insurance. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) took up the question in the fall of 1957 and established a Subcommittee to Study the Use and Application of Minimum Group Life Insurance Rates. Population data was considered as a basis but rejected and thus the starting point for the new table was the experience from intercompany studies carried on by the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) Group Mortality Committee. The last available published report covered years 1950-54. In order to be completely current however, the Committee decided to add the unpublished experience for the four additional calendar years through 1958. The intercompany studies are based on the experience of employer-employee groups with 25 employees or more. Data with respect to multiple-employer, union, professional association or other types of association groups were specifically excluded. Only the nonrated experience, comprising about 93% of the total exposure, was used. While the intercompany studies produce a tremendous amount of data, they are participated in by a relatively small number of underwriters. Thus an additional 136 companies were solicited to provide data which, together with those contributing to the intercompany studies, underwrite more than 99% of the group life insurance in the United States. Replies were received from a substantial number, but no useful data was obtained. Methodology: Data in the intercompany studies are submitted in quinquennial age groups on the basis of age nearest birthday. Since the table was to provide for the mortality element of minimum group life insurance premium rates, the next step was to consider the extent and form of the mortality margins in the final table, It was concluded that the basic mortality margins should be in the form of a percentage plus a constant: the combination of 20% of the experience rates at each age and a constant addition of one death per thousand appeared to give satisfactory results at most ages. It was thought desirable to complete the table to age 0. Therefore, the mortality rates were graded into 117.5% of the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) Table (See SOA Table Identities 5 and 6) at age 18, and the same percentage of the 1958 CSO Table was used down to age 0. It was decided to grade into 105% of the 1958 CSO Table for ages 73 and above and thus maintain a consistent margin over the latter at all ages, except that the table would come back to 100% of the 1958 CSO Table at age 99 and have the same limiting age of 100. The last step was to obtain the final table in the form of qx's at individual ages: (i) For ages zero to 18, the mortality rates in the final table are equal to 117.5 \"/o of the 1958 CSO Table qx's. The age zero rate is for age one day, corresponding to that in the 1958 CSO Table. (ii) For ages 19 to 61, the rates were obtained by applying Jenkins' Fifth Difference Modified Osculatory Interpolation Formula to the quinquennial qx values derived, (iii) For ages 62 to 70, the rates are based on a grading of the ratios of the qx's obtained by the application of Jenkins' Formula to the corresponding qx's from the 1958 CSO Table. In this way, slight modifications in the formula values at these ages were made in the interest of smoothness, (iv) For ages 71 to 98, the rates are 105% of the 1958 CSO Table qx's. (v) At age 99, the rate is 1.000. Data Transcription Errors: None. Data Certified: 05/2013",
