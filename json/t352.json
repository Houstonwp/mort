    "comments": "Study Data: Based on Standard Ordinary issues from the 16 companies which had been contributing to the Joint Committee on Mortality’s regular annual studies for the period 1946-49.While the volume of material accumulated between 1946 and 1949 policy anniversaries is not as extensive as would perhaps have been desirable, this period was chosen to avoid anomalies that could have resulted by inclusion of the war years. Two tables were developed: a select table in quinquennial age bands based on the first 15 policy years and an ultimate table based on policy anniversaries for years 16 and after. The two tables were developed independently thus the rates in the second table are not \"ultimate\" in the sense that they represent the level to which the select rates will rise after the effects of selection have worn off. NOTE: A prior generation of this table only included the ultimate portion of the table. The select portion is now also available and listed based on the central age of the quinquennial age band. Methodology: The select portion of the table was graduated with a Whittaker-Henderson second-difference A formula, with a = 1. It was applied to the ratios of the crude mortality rates to the 1925-1939 Basic Table rates (See SOA Table Identity 1709), first for each duration separately, and then, after an adjustment to improve the fidelity to the original data, for each age group separately. The resulting mortality rates were subsequently adjusted empirically and by re-graduation in order to improve the fit, obtain greater consistency with ultimate rates at younger attained ages, and reduce the irregularities in the series. The ultimate portion of the table was graduated by means of a Whittaker-Henderson third-difference A formula, with a = 3. Adjustments at both ends of the table were considered desirable. At the upper end of the table, the original graduation produced decreasing first differences after age 87. The mortality rates were adjusted so that first differences at those ages remained constant. At the young age end, the mortality rates around age 25 appeared low relative to other observed rates. Accordingly, the mortality rates at ages 25-29 were raised to a level equal to 47% of the rates in the U.S. 1939-1941 White Males Table (See SOA Table Identity 530). Data Transcription Errors: None.
