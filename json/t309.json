    "comments": "Study Data: Under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) was established to administer a benefits program that offered four different types of retirement annuities. Congress’ intent was to encourage the retirement of older railroad workers and to provide jobs to younger workers and generally improve the operation of the railroads with stronger, more able bodies (H.R. Rep. No. 1711, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 10 [1935]). In conjunction with the Act, the RRB must prepare an annual report on the actuarial status of the railroad retirement system and to submit the report to the Congress. However, the information available to the RRB on deaths of covered employees was felt too incomplete and fragmentary to permit valid mortality investigations in 1944. Therefore data associated with group life insurance experience for steam railroad employees from the period 1939-1941 was used. Methodology: Data underlying the group life experience for steam railroad employees was derived from the reports of the Committee on Group Mortality Investigations for 1932-41 and for 1932-38. Any improvements in mortality between the periods of study and the term covered by the RRB’s annual report was accounted for by applying a 1-year set-back in age. Data Transcription Errors: None.
